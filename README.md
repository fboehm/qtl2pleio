# qtl2pleio

The goal of qtl2pleio is to perform a likelihood ratio test that
distinguishes between competing hypotheses of presence of two separate
QTL (alternative hypothesis) and pleiotropy (null hypothesis) in QTL
studies in multiparental populations, such as the Diversity Outbred
mouse population. `qtl2pleio` data structures are those used in the
`rqtl/qtl2` package.
