* This is a new release.

* This is a resubmission of an initially rejected package. It was requested that I add a citation with a DOI to the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file. The original 1995 article from Jiang and Zeng doesn't have a doi, presumably due to its early publication date. I've thus added a related 2016 reference that does have a doi.
