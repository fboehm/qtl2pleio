\title{Calculate estimated allele effects, B matrix}
\usage{
calc_Bhat(X, Sigma_inv, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{2n by 2f block-diagonal design matrix that incorporates genetic info for two markers. Note that we can use the same marker data twice.}

\item{Sigma_inv}{2n by 2n inverse covariance matrix, often composed as the inverse of \eqn{K \otimes V_g + I_n \otimes V_e}}

\item{Y}{2n by 1 matrix, ie, a column vector, of 2 phenotypes' measurements}
}
