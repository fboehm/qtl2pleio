\description{
`scan_pvl` calculates log likelihood for d-variate phenotype model fits. Inputted parameter `start_snp` indicates where in the `probs` object to start the scan.
}
\details{
The function first discards individuals with one or more missing phenotypes or missing covariates.
It then infers variance components, Vg and Ve. Both Vg and Ve
are d by d covariance matrices. It uses an expectation maximization algorithm, as
implemented in the `gemma2` R package. `gemma2` R package is an R implementation of the
GEMMA algorithm for multivariate variance component estimation (Zhou & Stephens 2014 Nature methods).
Note that variance components are fitted on a model that uses the d-variate phenotype
but contains no genetic information. This model does, however,
use the specified covariates (after dropping dependent columns
in the covariates matrix).
These inferred covariance matrices, \eqn{\hat{Vg}} and \eqn{\hat{Ve}},
are then used in subsequent model fitting via
generalized least squares.
Generalized least squares model fitting is applied to every d-tuple of
markers within the specified genomic region for `scan_pvl`.
For a single d-tuple of markers, we fit the model:
\deqn{vec(Y) = Xvec(B) + vec(G) + vec(E)} where
\deqn{G \sim MN(0, K, \hat{Vg})} and \deqn{E \sim MN(0, I, \hat{Ve})} where \eqn{MN} denotes the matrix-variate
normal distribution with three parameters: mean matrix, covariance among rows, and
covariance among columns. \eqn{vec} denotes the vectorization operation, ie, stacking by columns.
\eqn{K} is a kinship matrix, typically calculated by leave-one-chromosome-out methods.
\eqn{Y} is the n by d phenotypes matrix. \eqn{X} is a block-diagonal nd by fd matrix consisting of
d blocks each of dimension n by f. Each n by f block (on the diagonal) contains a matrix of
founder allele probabilities for the n subjects at a single marker. The off-diagonal blocks
have only zero entries.
The log-likelihood is returned for each model. The outputted object is a tibble with
d + 1 columns. The first d columns specify the markers used in the corresponding model fit, while
the last column specifies the log-likelihood value at that d-tuple of markers.
