\title{Determine if all genotype probability vectors for markers in an interval are the same for one subject.}
\usage{
id_recombination(index1, index2, probs)
}
\arguments{
\item{index1}{an integer denoting the left-hand marker.}

\item{index2}{an integer denoting the right-hand marker.}

\item{probs}{a genotype probabilities 2-dimensional array for the appropriate chromosome and a single subject}
}
\description{
Determine if all genotype probability vectors for markers in an interval are the same for one subject.
}
\details{
Checks genotype probability vector (at each marker in interval) for equality with the left-hand marker's genotype probabilities vector.
