\arguments{
\item{probs}{founder allele probabilities three-dimensional array for one chromosome only (not a list)}

\item{pheno}{n by d matrix of phenotypes}

\item{addcovar}{n by c matrix of additive numeric covariates}

\item{kinship}{a kinship matrix, not a list}

\item{start_snp}{positive integer indicating index within probs for start of scan}

\item{n_snp}{number of (consecutive) markers to use in scan}

\item{pleio_peak_index}{positive integer index indicating genotype matrix for bootstrap sampling. Typically acquired by using `find_pleio_peak_tib`.}

\item{nboot}{number of bootstrap samples to acquire and scan}

\item{max_iter}{maximum number of iterations for EM algorithm}

\value{
numeric vector of (log) likelihood ratio test statistics from `nboot_per_job` bootstrap samples

\description{
Create a bootstrap sample, perform multivariate QTL scan, and calculate log10 LRT statistic
}
\details{
Performs a parametric bootstrap method to calibrate test statistic values in the test of
pleiotropy vs. separate QTL. It begins by inferring parameter values at
the `pleio_peak_index` index value in the object `probs`. It then uses
these inferred parameter values in sampling from a multivariate normal
distribution. For each of the `nboot` sampled phenotype vectors, a two-dimensional QTL
scan, starting at the marker indexed by `start_snp` within the object
`probs` and extending for a total of `n_snp` consecutive markers. The
two-dimensional scan is performed via the function `scan_pvl_clean`. For each
two-dimensional scan, a log10 likelihood ratio test statistic is calculated. The
outputted object is a vector of `nboot` log10 likelihood ratio test
statistics from `nboot` distinct bootstrap samples.
