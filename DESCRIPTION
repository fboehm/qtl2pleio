Description: The package contains code that implements an
    adaptation of Jiang & Zeng's (1995) likelihood ratio test for testing
    the null hypothesis of pleiotropy against the alternative hypothesis,
    close linkage. The test differs from that in Jiang & Zeng (1995) in
    that our test accommodates multiparental populations.
