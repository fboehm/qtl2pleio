Description: The package contains code that implements an adaptation of Jiang & Zeng's (1995) likelihood ratio test for testing the null hypothesis of pleiotropy against the alternative hypothesis, close linkage. The test differs from that in Jiang & Zeng (1995) in that our test accommodates multiparental populations.
