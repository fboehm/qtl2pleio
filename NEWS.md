* Started using Github Actions for continuous integration testing.





# qtl2pleio 1.4.3

## Major changes

* None

## Minor changes

* Updated RcppExports.cpp and deleted C++ test files that aren't used.





# qtl2pleio 1.4.2.9000

## Major changes

* added function `convert_to_scan1_output` to convert multivariate, one-QTL lods to output format of `qtl2::scan1`, for use in `qtl2::bayes_int`.

## Minor changes

* None



# qtl2pleio 1.4.1

## Major changes
 
* None

## Minor changes

* Added vignette to .Rbuildignore to ease CRAN submission.


# qtl2pleio 1.4.0

## Major changes

* Refactored `scan_pvl` and `boot_pvl` to reduce duplicated code
* Added functions for genomewide, multivariate, one-QTL scan

## Minor changes

* Returned to parallelization implemented by R package `parallel`.
* Set default `cores` value to `parallelly::availableCores()` for compatibility with job schedulers.



# qtl2pleio 1.3.0

## Major changes

* Replaced `parallel` package use with `furrr`. This led to removal of the argument 
`n_cores` from both `boot_pvl` and `scan_pvl`. A user may now use `future::plan` to 
run in parallel.
* Moved vignettes to website: https://fboehm.us/software/qtl2pleio

## Minor changes

* Fixed argument name in `boot_pvl`, changing `nboot_per_job` to `nboot`.
* Created function `scan_pvl_clean` to be called in both `scan_pvl` and `boot_pvl`. This change shouldn't affect most users' experiences.
